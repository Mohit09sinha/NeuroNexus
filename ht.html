          <p>
            Biryani came to India from the Iranian lands, and stayed here to become a part of our cuisine since then. In 15 th Century AD India, Biryani was a quick wholesome meal easy for troops on the move. In 21 st Century AD, it is a symbol of salvation for food connoisseurs so much so that one can never hold their urge to dig in to a warm steaming Biryani.<br>
